# Fizz Buzz
You're given an integer n as a parameter. You're method must print out all the numbers from 0 to n (inclusive).
There are only three exceptions: 
1. When the number is divisible by 3, you print out "Fizz".
2. When the number is divisible by 5, you must print out "Buzz".
3. When the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you must print out "FizzBuzz"
### Example
```
method_name(15)
>> 0 1 2 "Fizz" 4 "Buzz" "Fizz" 7 8 9 "Buzz" 11 12 13 14 "FizzBuzz"
```
