# Fibonacci Sequence Soliution

#### Recursive

```
int fib(int n)
{
   if (n <= 1)
      return n;
   return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
```
 Time Complexity: T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) which is exponential.

 ```
We can observe that this implementation does a lot of repeated work (see the following recursion tree). So this is a bad implementation for nth Fibonacci number.

                         fib(5)   
                     /             \     
               fib(4)                fib(3)   
             /      \                /     \
         fib(3)      fib(2)         fib(2)    fib(1)
        /     \        /    \       /    \  
  fib(2)   fib(1)  fib(1) fib(0) fib(1) fib(0)
  /    \
fib(1) fib(0)

```
Extra Space: O(n) if we consider the function call stack size, otherwise O(1).

#### Dynamic Programming
We can avoid the repeated work done is the method 1 by storing the Fibonacci numbers calculated so far.

```
int fib(int n)
{
  /* Declare an array to store Fibonacci numbers. */
  int f[n+1];
  int i;

  /* 0th and 1st number of the series are 0 and 1*/
  f[0] = 0;
  f[1] = 1;

  for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
  {
      /* Add the previous 2 numbers in the series
         and store it */
      f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2];
  }

  return f[n];
}

```

Time Complexity: O(n)
Extra Space: O(n)
