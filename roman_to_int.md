# Integer to Roman Numeral
You are given an int parameter, `n`. `n` is an Arabic Number. Your method must convert the Arabic Number into a Roman Numeral and return its Roman Numeral form as a string.
### Example
```
method_name(1) --> "I"
method_name(6) --> "VI"
method_name(143) --> "CXLIII"
```
Assume the Roman Numeral String you are given is < 1000.
